# Template for React applications (using Gulp)
  
The target audience of this template is JavaScript developers wanting to play with React without any of the dependencies (Gulp, npm, compiling, etc). The goal is to be up and running in five minutes and only have to run one command when you want to develop.

Shouldn’t you take the time to learn all the dependencies?  I don’t know.  I guess so.  Maybe later?
